# Min_Entropy
The repository contains programs to find minimum entropy of a random source using neural network. The module is based on papers [On the Analysis and Improvement of Min-Entropy Estimation on Time-Varying Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8871148) and [Neural Network Based Min-entropy Estimation for Random Number Generators](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01704-0_13)
